 This is the Jet Reports fork of EPPlus ( https://epplus.codeplex.com/ , (C) 2011-2017 Jan KÃ¤llman and others as noted in the source code.)

### How this fork differs from the mainline:
* We enforce [a Coding Standard](https://github.com/jetreports/EPPlus/wiki/Coding-Standard), which requires:
	* Unit tests for all code changes,
	* Full-word variable names,
	* XML method comments,
	* The removal of commented-out code,
	* And more!
	    
	
* This fork contains dozens of bug fixes and enhancements:
	* Improved excel function implementations,
	* Better support for Excel-generated Charts,
	* Bugfixes to the CellStore, ExcelWorkbook/Worksheet, and other core classes,
	* Other fixes and improvements as noted in the commit history.
* This fork is NOT the source code for the EPPlus NuGet Package; we do not maintain the NuGet Package.
	* The source code for the NuGet can be found [here](https://epplus.codeplex.com/).

### Why these changes are not on the mainline:
* There are some half-cooked features in this fork (We've added support for updating existing charts, but not inserting new charts, for example); we need these features, but Jan and swmal are understandably hesitant to include these half-cooked features in the EPPlus mainline. 
* Our coding standard requirement makes it much easier to read and maintain the code going forward, but much harder to merge with a non-standardized fork of EPPlus.
* We used to be responsible for approximately 75% of all EPPlus pull requests, so it made sense for us to maintain our own fork so we could handle our own pull requests in a timely manner.
